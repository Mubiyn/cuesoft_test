# cuesoft_test

This is the Cuesoft Flutter Developer Code test. Please read instructions carefully. 
You have just 30 mins. Try to complete as many steps as possible.

## Getting Started

You will be required to complete simple tasks on this app.
Kindly clone the repo to get started and checkout to branch <your-name>.

Steps:
- Create a simple login screen and welcome screen.
- The login screen should have two simple texfield widgets and a button which will have an onTap function.
- The welcome screen should have a simple text widget which says "Welcome to Cuesoft Developer Test"
- The onTap function should connect to this endpoint (http://restapi.adequateshop.com/api/authaccount/login), and if successful (status code 200 is the only thing required), should navigate to the welcome screen.
- Write appropriate tests for your app.
- You are free to persist state if you have enough time.
- Push your code to github before your time elapses.

Note: 
You are free to use any resource and package (http, dio, provider, etc), of your choice. Whether it is a previous code you have written, google or any other means. You are not allowed to copy and paste though. All the very best.
Your folder structure and code pattern will be part of your score. Ensure to follow best practices.
